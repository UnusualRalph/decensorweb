**decensorweb** is a social media platform dedicated to upholding freedom of speech by removing government-mandated censorship. This project was born from the direct need for a space where individuals can criticize their governments and discuss political reality without fear of being silenced or banned.

## 🚀 The Mission

* **Anti-Censorship:** Built specifically to counter the increasing amount of government-driven suppression found on mainstream platforms.
* **Political Accountability:** A dedicated space for users to voice concerns and critiques regarding their leadership.
* **Always Free:** This is a free platform for the people, by the people.

## 🎯 Our Aim

* **Safety First:** Create a secure environment for global communication.
* **Unfiltered Thought:** Empower users to share their thoughts and experiences freely.
* **Zero Hate Speech:** We strictly distinguish between political dissent and hate speech. **We do not promote or host hate speech.**
